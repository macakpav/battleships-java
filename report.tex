easily addable ship types
interface like game object should probably allow for easy implementation of more game stuff - islands, ships/speedboats (objects of one - limited due to only using LinearPlacement right now)

The GUI code is pretty ugly, but I went through a lot of trouble to get it working at least like this, but with this experience i would do organize it a bit differently. On the other hand i think I did a pretty good job in keeping game logic and the GUI separated.
